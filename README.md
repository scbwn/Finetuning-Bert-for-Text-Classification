# LLM Fine-Tuning for Text Classification

## Project Overview

This repository contains a TensorFlow implementation of fine-tuning the pre-trained BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) Large Language Model (LLM) on the AG News dataset for text classification.

## Dataset

- AG News Dataset: A benchmark dataset for text classification, consisting of 120,000 news articles categorized into 4 classes (World, Sports, Business, and Sci/Tech)

## Implementation

- Fine-tuning pre-trained BERT (base cased) LLM using TensorFlow
- Custom dataset loader and data preprocessing (tokenization)
- Training and evaluation scripts

## Features

- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on AG News dataset
- Easy-to-use and adaptable code for other text classification tasks
- Documentation and instructions for reproduction

## Requirements

- TensorFlow 2.x
- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. Clone repository
2. Install requirements
3. Download AG News dataset
4. Run training script
